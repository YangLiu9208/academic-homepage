I am currently a Postdoctoral Research Associate in Geophysics at
[Michigan State University](https://msu.edu/),
collaboration with Prof. [Songqiao Shawn Wei](https://msu.edu/~swei/).
I received my Ph.D. degree
from [University of Science and Technology of China](http://en.ustc.edu.cn/)
in 2018 advised by [Prof. Lianxing Wen](http://geophysics.geo.sunysb.edu/wen/).

I am passionate about contributing to a further understanding of structure
of the Earth's deep interior, characteristics of seismic sources
(e.g. Microseismic, Explosions, Collapse) and numerical simulations of seismic wavefield propagation.

I am a fan of open source and serve as a core developer of
[the Generic Mapping Tools (GMT)](https://www.generic-mapping-tools.org/) and
[PyGMT](https://www.pygmt.org/).
