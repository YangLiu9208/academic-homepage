Dongdong Tian is a Ph.D. Candidate in Geophysics at
[University of Science and Technology of China](http://en.ustc.edu.cn/),
supervised by Prof. [Lianxing Wen](http://geophysics.geo.sunysb.edu/wen/).

He is passionate about contributing to a further understanding of structure
of the Earth's deep interior, characteristics of seismic sources
(e.g. Microseismic, Collaspe) and numerical simulations of seismic wavefield propagation.
He is working on the study of
[fine-scale structure of the Earth's inner core boundary](research/inner-core-boundary/).

He is a fan of open source and also contributes to geophysics-related softwares, such as
[GMT](http://gmt.soest.hawaii.edu/),
[SAC](https://seiscode.iris.washington.edu/projects/sac)
and [ObsPy](http://docs.obspy.org/).
