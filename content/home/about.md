Dongdong Tian is a Ph.D. in Geophysics at
[University of Science and Technology of China](http://en.ustc.edu.cn/),
supervised by Prof. [Lianxing Wen](http://geophysics.geo.sunysb.edu/wen/).

He is passionate about contributing to a further understanding of structure
of the Earth's deep interior, characteristics of seismic sources
(e.g. Microseismic, Explosions, Collaspe) and numerical simulations of seismic wavefield propagation.
He is working on the study of
[fine-scale structure of the Earth's inner core boundary]({{< ref "project/inner-core-boundary.md" >}}).

He is a fan of open source and also contributes to geophysics-related softwares, such as
[GMT](http://gmt.soest.hawaii.edu/),
[SAC](https://seiscode.iris.washington.edu/projects/sac)
and [ObsPy](http://docs.obspy.org/).
