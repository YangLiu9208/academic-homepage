I am currently a Postdoctoral Research Associate in Geophysics at
[Michigan State University](https://msu.edu/),
collaboration with Prof. [Songqiao Shawn Wei](https://msu.edu/~swei/).
I received my Ph.D. degree from University of Science and Technology of China in 2018
advised by [Prof. Lianxing Wen](http://geophysics.geo.sunysb.edu/wen/).

I am passionate about contributing to a further understanding of structure
of the Earth's deep interior, characteristics of seismic sources
(e.g. Microseismic, Explosions, Collaspe) and numerical simulations of seismic wavefield propagation.

I am a fan of open source and also contribute to geophysics-related softwares, such as
[GMT](http://gmt.soest.hawaii.edu/),
[GMT/Python](https://www.gmtpython.xyz/),
[SAC](https://seiscode.iris.washington.edu/projects/sac)
and [ObsPy](http://docs.obspy.org/).
