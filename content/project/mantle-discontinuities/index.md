title: Mantle Discontinuities
summary: |
  Seismic discontinuities in the mantle provide critical insight into thermal
  and compositional states of Earth's mantle and its dynamics.
  The 410- and 660-km seismic discontinuities are observed globally, and
  are generally linked to phase transformations of olivine → wadsleyite and
  ringwoodite → bridgmanite + ferropericlase. The 520- and 560-km discontinuities
  are usually less observed and studied, and are caused by phase transformation of
  wadsleyite → ringwoodite, and exsolution of Ca-pv from garnet. We analyze
  waveforms of SS precuros recorded by global stations to investigate global
  variations of the 520- and 560-km discontinuities.
