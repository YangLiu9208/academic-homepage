# Abstract.
abstract = """Deep earthquakes exhibit strong variabilities in their rupture
and aftershock characteristics, yet their physical failure mechanisms remain elusive.
The 2018 Mw 8.2 and Mw 7.9 Tonga-Fiji deep earthquakes, the two largest ever
recorded in this subduction zone, occurred within days of each other.
We investigate these events by performing waveform analysis,
teleseismic P-wave back-projection, and aftershock relocation.
Our results show that the Mw 8.2 earthquake ruptured fast (4.1 km/s) and
excited frequency dependent seismic radiation, whereas the Mw 7.9 earthquake
ruptured slowly (2.5 km/s). Both events lasted ~35 s. The Mw 8.2 earthquake
initiated in the highly seismogenic, cold core of the slab and likely
ruptured into the surrounding warmer materials, whereas the Mw 7.9 earthquake
likely ruptured through a dissipative process in a previously aseismic region.
The contrasts in earthquake kinematics and aftershock productivity argue for
a combination of at least two primary mechanisms enabling rupture in the region.
